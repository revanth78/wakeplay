# WakePlay

WakePlay is a mobile alarm app that wakes users gently and reliably with their own music: at the scheduled alarm time WakePlay automatically starts a Spotify or YouTube playlist and displays a simple ringing UI with Stop and Skip controls (no snooze). 

## MVP 
- Connect Spotify or YouTube, pick a playlist, schedule an alarm, and at the alarm time automatically start the playlist with an in-app ringing screen that allows Stop and Skip.

## Why this?
- People prefer waking up to familiar music rather than a harsh alarm tone.
